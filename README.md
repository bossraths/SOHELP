# IDEA

SOHELP is a mobile/web application where people can register themselves anonymously. HELPER (one who wants to help) can select topics for which they want to provide help. NEEDER (one who needs help) can select specific topic for which they need help and select the connect option which will connect them to any availble HELPER. NEEDER/ NEEDERs and HELPER/ HELPERs can talk anonymously and thus we can provide help to people whenever we want.
